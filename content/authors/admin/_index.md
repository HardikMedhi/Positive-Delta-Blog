Welcome to Positive Delta! As time goes on, my unceasing exposure to scientific ideas has made me understand that mathematical equations, physical constants, chemical symbols, biological cycles and computational blocks are just random lines on a piece of paper. The human brains' unique ability of playing with abstract ideas was able to take those random lines and revolutionize today's world.

And that is the goal of my channel and blog. I hope to initiate a conversation about fascinating ideas with the folk who share an interest. Let's learn how to think critically and independently.

Oh, and my name is Hardik Medhi :D

Stay Curious!
